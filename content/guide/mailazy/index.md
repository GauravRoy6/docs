6. Copy the CNAME records and update them on your Domain.

   >**Note:** Sometimes it might take up to 24 hours to reflect the DNS changes. If verification fails, you should wait and verify later.

7. Click the **Verify** button to verify your domain.

8. Upon successful verification, it generates **Key** and **Secret** that you can use to configure Mailazy as <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/docs/developer/guide/setup-your-smtp-provider" target="blank"> SMTP provider in LoginRadius </a>. The configuration has been explained [below](#smtp-mailazy-configurations).

   >**Note:** You can use generated **Key** and **Secret** to integrate Mailazy for sending emails in any application.

   >**Note:** Make sure to copy **Key** and **Secret**. To get these values later, you will have to regenerate/reset. 
   > 
   >If you reset API Key and Secret, any API calls you have developed will stop working until you update them with  new values.
